Installation:
    Linux:
        1. Unity:
            Unity offers relatively painless and consistent installation using their unity hub
            https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux
            After intalling unity hub user can install latest LTS version using "Install Editor" button
        2. Unreal:
            Installing Unreal on Linux is a bit more complicated, user can either:
                a) get access to official epic github organization https://github.com/EpicGames and unreal repository, clone and build engine https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine
                b) download precompiled unreal bin package and run it https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux
            There is NO LTS version
Initial usage:
    Linux:
        1. Unity:



Unity is better for 2D -> it has special 2D ONLY view, physics and so on
Unreal 2D is always "fake" 2D -> it is 3D but we hide our third dimension
